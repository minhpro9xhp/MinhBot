The reason for slow,"If you saw my tweet yesterday about being single now, that's the reason I haven't had that much inspiration lately to work on a game as big as 0x10c, and hopefully it explains why I haven't spoken much about the reason.

"Overview of the DCPU-16 for Newbies (to end the ""Where's a tutorial"" messages)","**EDIT: Special thanks to the 0x10c wiki for adding a link to this page, I'm honored to have been noticed and I hope this information is helpful to any readers!**

I'm not too familiar with assembly, but I do know my way around computers and I can program, so I poked around at Notch's setup (like so many other people) and got a feel for the whole thing. While the others are busy making assemblers/deassemblers/compilers (hah I wish)/whatchamacallits, I've decided to write a simple overview of the system, so that even YOU* can try your hand at ""self-sufficiency"". For the purpose of this tutorial, I’ll be looking at [Mappum’s awesome emulator](http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16/) for any and all examples. To use it, put any assembly code you write in the left box, hit reset, hit compile, and then press step to step through cycles and watch it run. I suggest not pressing run, as things might move too quickly.

*YOU: Someone with little to no programming experience

**Anyway, let's get started:**

Essentially, the entire DCPU-16 is a bunch of RAM. Really, that’s about it (kinda, don’t tell the experienced coders I said this). Each “word” of RAM (of which there are 65,536) is four characters of hex. Hex is a number system that’s base-16 (unlike ours which is base-10) and always starts with “0x” (seen that anywhere else?). I’m not going to explain hex here, so you can Google that if you want (though, Google is really cool, and will translate hex to decimal if you enter “0x#### to decimal” and replace #s with the actual characters). Anyway, four characters of hex is 16 digits of binary, which allows us a number between 0 and 65,535 for each word. Cool, right?

What’s in a word though? Well, it can be tons of things. Usually, the first bunch of words in RAM will contain the code for a project, because that’s just how it is. Still, even though it’s considered “code” it’s really just a number. But, you don’t have to worry about that, since assemblers take care of translating your code into the numbers for you. Instead, just understand that different places in the RAM might contain information that tells the CPU how to run.

Other places could just contain values. Maybe you need to store the number 42 so you always know what the ultimate answer is, for example. Though, outside of RAM are 8 registers that can also be used to store values. These are labeled a, b, c, x, y, z, i, and j. This is nice, because instead of having to remember to call up [0x1A32] for a value each time you need it, you can just have it assigned to one of those registers. That [0x1A32] references a specific spot in RAM, in that case it would call on the 6,706th word. The []s signify that we’re grabbing the value at that location, instead of just talking about the location (if we’re setting it to a value) or a number (if we want to set something else to 0x1A32). But, we’ll kind of touch on that later.

If you’ve played around with Mappum’s emulator, you’ve probably also noticed the “PC” below all of the registers. PC refers to the specific spot in memory that’s being read at that point in time. It starts at 0000 (so reading the first spot in memory) and works its way up indefinitely. This will be very important later on, because it can be modified just like other values (so the CPU will read whatever word you want, instead of just going up and up and up), but it’s important I explain the basic commands first.

Commands (or opcodes, as they’re actually referred to as) are really small values in RAM that serve as shortcuts for telling the computer what to do. Because we’re using Mappum’s emulator, we don’t have to worry about the values that they represent in RAM, because we get to just type the actual command and have everything handled for us. The first, and probably most important, example is this:

    SET a, b

This, quite simply, sets one value to another. “a” is the value you’re modifying, and it can pretty much be anything. It can be a register (like “A” or “X”), a spot in memory (like [0x1000]), the PC, or a couple other things that I’m not going to get into for the purpose of presenting the absolute basics. “b” can really be any of these things as well. For instance, if you want to set register B to 1, you could type “SET B, 0x0001”. Then, if you wanted to set register A to the value of register B, you could type “SET A, B”. Other commands can [be found here](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt), but I’ll give you two more examples just for show:

    ADD a, b

This one works very similarly to SET, but, instead of setting “a” to “b”, adds “b” to whatever “a” is. The same is for SUB (subtract), MUL (multiple), DIV (divide), and a few others. These will also modify O (overflow) if they, well, overflow, but don’t worry about that too much for now. Finally:

    IFE a, b

There are a couple IF statements built in, but this is the most basic. Basically, it will perform the following line (command) as long as “a” equals “b”. At the end of this overview, I’ll dissect a really simple FOR loop, which uses IFN (runs if “a” doesn’t equal “b”) which should help explain how this works in more detail. Before that, however, there’s one last important basic to show you.

    :a

This is how we label subroutines in this kind of assembly. Essentially, you’ll replace “a” with whatever you want to call your subroutine, and that way you can target it whenever you need to. For example, if I use one line of my program to type “:testsub”, and on the next line I type “SET PC, testsub” it will set PC to the location in RAM that I entered “:testsub” sending the execution of code back to wherever that happened to be. To really wrap together this, and everything else I explained here, I’ll outline a really simple loop:

    SET I, 0x000A
    :loop
        SUB I, 0x0001
        IFN I, 0
            SET PC, loop
        SET A, 0xFFFF

The first line of this sets register I to 0x000A, which is hex for 10. The next line creates the subroutine “loop”. Directly after that, it subtracts 0x0001 (1) from I. Then, using “IFN” it checks I, and if I doesn’t equal 0, it sets PC to loop, causing the execution of code to return to that point. This subtracts another 1 from I, and checks again to see if I is 0. Once I is 0, it will stop setting PC back to loop, and continues to the next line where A is set to 0xFFFF (65,535).

I hope this overview has been helpful to you. I have to go now, so I can’t respond to any questions or comments until tomorrow, but I appreciate anything you guys have to say. Also, if any actual professionals would like to make a correction, just leave me a message (or a comment) and I’ll check it when I get the chance. Thanks!

EDIT: Typed this in Google Docs so I wouldn't lose anything, but that meant losing access to RES ""Insert-A-Link"" functionality. Fixed broken links. Also, I ""need"" to stop using """"s.

**EDIT 2**: As per user request, I ended up writing a little explanation of the stack (SP, POP, PUSH, PEEK). I don't know how correct I am, because I'm not too familiar with the idea (I only know similar concepts), but you can find what I wrote [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rvs5g/overview_of_the_dcpu16_for_newbies_to_end_the/c495cjw)

**EDIT 3**: maximinus-thrax added some extra advice about registers regarding the use of brackets to point at spots in memory. It's very well worded and worth a look if you're confused: [click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rvs5g/overview_of_the_dcpu16_for_newbies_to_end_the/c495pnt)",http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rvs5g/overview_of_the_dcpu16_for_newbies_to_end_the/

Do you think that the name of this game will prevent it from becoming popular?,"""Minecraft"" is a simple and easy-to-remember title that describes the content of the game.

""0x10c"" is just weird. It doesn't look like the title of a game, just looks like someone mashed their fingers on a keyboard. It says nothing about the content of the game. Most people don't know how to activate superscript characters, so they won't be able to type the c.

"0x10c, a week (or so) on","Wow! Let me say that again. Wow!

I never played Minecraft. I watched about ten minutes of it and thought it was just not my kind of game. I did make a token attempt at writing a client for it, until I saw what a fubar the network protocol spec is.

I have never been in the Cult of Notch. I watched about four minutes of his Ludum Dare live stream, until I stopped to do my own Ludum Dare project.

I was a child of the 80s. I learned to program on a TI-99/4A. I've been a professional programmer for pushing 20 years now. I have done a little bit of embedded stuff (Parallax chips and Lego NXT, mostly).

This project has the potential for over-the-top awesomeness. I spent time in Corewars, and C-Robots, and Terrarium.net, and I *love* this kind of game. It appeals to me *way* more than mining big blocks. I could actually see myself never actually playing 0x10c at all; just making software for it.

I have been blown away by some of the talent in this (and /r/dcpu16) reddit. There are some pretty good coders in here. I wrote my own assembler, and I'm about done with a higher level (basic-ish) language, but some of the full studio platforms have been impressive. I'm almost hesitant to release anything, given some of the other tools that are out already.

I have been dismayed by some of the fan-boy-ism as well. I guess that goes with the territory. Notch has such *amazing* community capital, that he can release a *hint* of a game, and people are already jumping to create community standards and speculating about things that are utterly vaporware at this point. You can't buy that kind of influence. People are learning *assembly*. That is pretty amazing.

I don't know what to expect in the future. I made some language tools, which have been in my bucket list for a while. The ""game"" part of all of this doesn't really sound that fun. But who knows. Me speculating on the game is just as silly as anyone else speculating on the game.

So the last week has been a mixed bag. I'll wait and see what the next few weeks bring before I render any kind of solid verdict.

Clock precision -- an opportunity,"The amount of time passing between going to sleep and waking up is very large. Any discrepancy between the clocks of two different units would mean waking up lifetimes after someone else. 

Assuming that there is some tracking device making sure everyone wakes up near enough to each other not to have been red-shifted away, I think this could be an opportunity: Discovery of a long-dead community.

This other community had already grouped together, lived and died by the time our wave of travellers arrives. I think we could find them in a distant reach of the space, orbiting something. The region would be devoid of minerals, but there would be equipment, etc.

And codes.

You see, I think that some of what we all come up with before the game is launched could all be loaded up over there, or perhaps require the player to go there to get a co-processor or somesuch. 

It becomes a quest through a barren land to a fabled place of riches.

And it would be a great place for Notch to hide an awful, awful virus...

If we had a beta version of the game, it could become the derelict community when it finishes...

A couple of space adventure games to keep you busy while you wait for a playable release of 0x10c,"I did some research for a cool space game, and here's what I found: Shores of Hazeron!

http://www.hazeron.com/

It's a neat little game, multiplayer, but can seem like a singleplayer game.
Basically, you start on a planet with nothing (Sounds like another game Notch has made before) From there you gather materials such as wood and stone to construct factories, farms, housing, and eventually spacecraft factories! Design your own spacecraft and explore the galaxy. Fight pirates or players, the choice is yours!


I'm not sure how similar 0x10c will be to Shores of Hazeron, but I think they may end up looking similar with graphics, but game play should be completely different.


Another game that may be similar is Pioneer. This game looks to be pretty cool, but really suck at it...

Notch may restart development on 0x10c to improve the gameplay goals,"Some of you may have read the Penny Arcade interview here: http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/notch-interview

In the article, Notch indicates that he may decide to restart development on 0x10c, at least in part, because as it stands the game just isn't fun. It's not very fun to walk around in the ship, a big part of what makes it cool

&gt;And I might possibly start over, because it feels like… it’s not fun, the stuff you’re actually doing. If it’s not fun to walk around the spaceship then the game isn’t fun. So I need to figure that out and try to, not necessarily gamify, but add more instant gratification. 


If Notch does backtrack to fix some of the game's engine, here are some suggestions I'd have:

 * Instead of placing shapes to design your ship, give us premade elements we can customize, like whole walls we can define the length of, or control panels we can adjust the placement of buttons on.

 * Stop trying too hard to stick to accurate science. Frankly, real life starship travel would be boring as heck. I prefer it if crashing into a planet means having to search for components to repair the ship rather than just dying. 

 * Once you have a basic way of creating the ship and moving around (and of course, once you have the DCPU back up, since that's the coolest goddamned part of this game's design) start working on how we will place things like engines, weapons, shields, etc. At the point where we have functioning engines, shields, and weapons, and then have I/O locations for the DCPU to control those things, we have something of a game to play around with, and you can actually release it to be played. 

Anyway. If Notch does restart development, what would you guys want him to change in the design to try to make it feel more fun?",http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/zeffz/notch_may_restart_development_on_0x10c_to_improve/

What I would like to see in 0x10c: Teraforming.,"I think the coolest thing ever for 0x10c would be Teraforming. So that a mined out asteroid is literally mined out, or a quarry on a planet is literally a chunk of dented earth. Entire moons could be eliminated from huge mining ops.

Since a good chunk of the planets are randomly generated and there aren't any textures in the game the idea of polygon pushing isn't that outlandish. I'm not sure how notch will implement models and how the netcode is going to work but it could be done. However,  physics could be an issue, since a moon losing 1/4 of its mass would change its orbit.

How fast should ships be able to travel?,"Maximum velocity of well-known ships in various universes:

* ***real-life***

NASA's Saturn V could travel at 6,000 miles per hours. This is *0.00000894698959 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Serenity*** / ***Firefly*** 

It would take Serenity about 2,770 years to travel a lightyear. This would be *0.000360962302 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Alien***

The Nostomo traveled 37 lightyears (11.35 parsecs) in 10 months giving it a speed of *44.4 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Star Trek*** (the original series)

Although it was a bit inconsistent, Warp 1 was the speed of light. The Enterprise's cruise speed of Warp 6 was 216 times the speed of light. By taking a great risk of damaging the warp core, Warp 9 could be obtained allowing travel at *729 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Star Trek: The Next Generation***

The warp scale has been adjusted since the original series. Warp 1 is still the speed of light, but Warp 10 is now the speed of being everywhere at once. The Enterprise D has an average cruise speed of Warp 6 (692.5 times the speed of light) and a max cruise speed of a little over Warp 9 which theoretically should have been 1516.38 times the speed of light, but was usually a little less that *1000 times the speed of light* in both *The Next Generation* and *Voyager*.

---

* ***Star Wars***

Exact speeds aren't discussed much - probably because of the whole Kessler Run thing. But if a star ship can cross the galaxy in around 4 days, we get *9 million times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Futurama***

The Planet Express Ship can travel at 97% the speed of the *new* speed of light. (Scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.) Farnsworth states it can travel between galaxies in hours.

 \- *9,000,000 times the speed of old light speed* (at the bare minimum - calculated nearest galaxy of Canis Major Dwarf taking a day to reach.)

 \- *2,000,000,000 times the speed of old light speed* (would be possible if it could travel to Andromeda II in 8 hours)

---


* ***0x10^c***

How fast should players be able to travel in 0x10c? What is a fun speed? The longest flight path in World of Warcraft takes about 30 minutes.[[1](http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-the-longest-flight-path-in-world-of-warcraft)] In Minecraft it takes about 40 minutes to travel 10,000 blocks by land under ideal conditions.

Star systems less than 10 ly away from our own:

system|distance
:--|:--
Rigil Kentaurus|4.3 ly
Barnard's Star|6.0 ly
Wolf 359|7.8 ly
Lalande 21185|8.3 ly
Sirius|8.6 ly
Luyten 726-8|8.7 ly
WISE 1541-2250|9.3 ly
V1216 Sagittarii|9.7 ly

If we could travel a lightyear per minute (*526,000 times the speed of light*) that might be a good speed, allowing us to travel to all stars in a 30 ly radius in 30 minutes or less.

In the future, though, there may not be so many stars. It might be better to think in terms of crossing the galaxy. Earth is about 27,000 ly away from the galaactic center of Milky Way. If we ca Milky Way is between 100k and 120k ly in diameter.

If we could travel at 1,000 ly per minute (*526,000,000 times the speed of light*) we could travel between earth and the galactic core in half an hour, or if we travel in the opposite direction, we could reach the fringe in about 30 minutes as well.

This would be within the realm of Futurama-type speeds. 

Here's a possible explanation - Maybe our ships can't travel faster than light, however over the hundreds of trillions of year with the aging and shifting of the universe, the maximum speed of light has increased by a billion times. Meanwhile, our ships only have a speed of around 5 times the speed of light.

This would explain why we would need hypersleep on ships that can travel across the galaxy in hours, because back in the 1980's it would have taken thousands of years.

**Edit:** Increasing the speed of light by a *trillion* times would allow light-based messages and network packets to reach any ship or planet anywhere in the galaxy in less than 4 seconds. This would be very useful for communications. Meanwhile, our space ships could be limited to a more reasonable 0.05% light speed.",http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/sx1l4/how_fast_should_ships_be_able_to_travel/

AlmOSt - an OS,"http://0x10co.de/6yzc

Well I was a little bored in the last few days, since it's summer holidays at uni and all. So I decided to write a little something for the DCPU.
So here I present to you my humble attempts to write an interactive commandline or OS if you want to call it that for the DCPU.

**Commands**

* help - prints help
* inc v- increases value and prints the result
* add v1 v2 - adds both values together and prints result
* sub v1 v2 - subtracts v2 from v1 and prints result
* sadd var v1 v2 - adds v1 and v2 and stores result in var
* ssub var v1 v2 - subtracts v2 from v1 and stores result in var

* dev dn A B C - sends an HWI interrupt to the device dn with A B and C * set according to parameters
* devicelist - prints a list of all recognized devices with their device numbers
* rdd sec - attempts to read the sector sec from a Harold Media Drive (Seems to be broken in the emulator)
* memset adr val - sets the memory at address adr to the value val
* newline - prints a new line (only useful for scripts)
* exec addr - starts interpreting a string starting at addr as console commands
* jne rel val1 val2 - jumps rel characters in the string if val1 and val 2 are not equal (unsigned so to jump backwards use 65536-rel as value for rel)
* asm cadr dadr - compiles assembly from cadr into machine code and stores the result at dadr (dadr must be bigger or equal to hb000)
* jsr adr - jumps to adr with a jsr instruction

**Values**

You can prefix values with h to have them interpreted as hex or v to read the value from a variable.
So h0010 would be 16 in dec and v10 would be the value of the variable with index 10



**Assembly**

* Labels can only have numeric values and need to be prefixed with a capital L
* Parameters are separated by spaces not by a comma
* You can only use capital letters for opcodes and registers
* Literal Values work the same as with the console commands (So write hfedc instead of 0xfedc)

[Edit]

Ad you can see in these two screenshots, I can now load modules from HMD at runtime, compile them and register commands for use with the console.

I would upload that to 0x10co.de but unfortunately their HMD implementation appears to be broken, at least for me.

Concerns regarding the recent style changes.,"Just some (frankly, negative) feedback on the current CSS style:

* Perhaps the main note, and biggest cause of concern: Do we really need such a dark theme? For starters, it clashes a *lot* with the standard Reddit, well, ""look"". More importantly, though, I can't read things, because there's nowhere near enough contrast between the background and the text. The idea of a colour scheme is to make text easy to read, not make things ""look cool"" or provide atmosphere. That can be a goal, but it's very secondary to ""present content nicely.""

* A lot of browser additions made for Reddit, designed to work with Reddit's default colourscheme and those close to it, judicially cause things to look even more broken, visually jarring and, well, generally bad. Yes, those who use RES (for example) can just turn off the style, ultimately leaving a out-of-place black logo (itself critique-able, but perhaps another time) against the familiar baby blues of Reddit.

* We know very little about 0x10c currently - Heck, less than a week ago we thought it was an April Fool's gag. We've seen, what, five screenshots, maximum? Hence, very little of the game's artistic, visual direction and design is known. With such little direction, do we really need a huge-wizz-bang custom CSS at the moment?

I can understand the want for a custom theme - Done right it can look darn impressive, such as the one over on r/atheism; but done wrong, I'd argue, perhaps even hurts the community by making the subreddit less visually attractive.

We have very little artistic direction from the game, currently, and while it's an appreciable effort, goal, and idea, I feel it's a quite premature.

It goes without saying, of course, but I mean to offend no-one. But the current style... I feel it should be removed, retooled, perhaps even developed on a subreddit designed for the purpose, re-implemented when we have more thematic data to work with.",http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rw80a/concerns_regarding_the_recent_style_changes/

Pretty much, it would be a repository of the most popular code out there.  You could buy code with galactic credits or whatever, and sell your code in a similar fashion.

""[11:16:59]	&lt;_notch&gt;	it will be the same multiverse, but it will be sharded""
""[11:17:26]	&lt;_notch&gt;	so the economy is shared, and large bases and structures are shared, but your adventures and skirmishes are sharded""
""[11:18:39]	&lt;_notch&gt;	hachque: Like guild wars. You choose who you want to play with""
""[11:42:44] &lt;_notch&gt; you choose who you play with a la guild wars, so you're safe by default""

So I hope I'm not the only one who hates this idea. It removes a huge amount of possibilities from the game.

I know notch has said he may change anything and he was just brainstorming but we need to let him know what we think about his ideas before he finalises them.

What do you think? If you agree let notch know how you feel!

I was personally hoping for some sort of eve like server structure.

Edit:

A lot of people have made some points about the lack of infrastructure present at Mojang and how that may effect Notch's decision about how to set up the server, my response would be that infrastructure doesn't just pop out of thin air Eve didn't start with a huge server farm so why would Notch?

As long as he writes the server in something other than Java he should be fine the physical hardware can be obtained, I do understand that this may or may not be profitable for notch but it really depends on how well he makes the server, If he makes it like he did the Minecraft server then we will be lucky if we don't lag out with 4 man instances.

Over the years CCP (the creators of eve) have often pointed out that a lot of the lag created in eve has a lot to do with poorly designed software, admittedly they also have some very powerful servers to help elevate the problem as well but this wasn't always the case the game grew slowly so there is no reason notch cant do the same.",http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/se9vm/worries_about_the_multiverse/

"I don't think Notch should give away his game for free!  I'm trying to make a suggestion about how to give the programming aspect of the game more robust library of software.  Now that that's out of the way, read on.

Notch has said he was interested in releasing 0x10c with the same billing structure as Minecraft by charging x for alpha, 1.5x for beta, and 2x for final release.  This is probably a good idea because it has worked in the past with Minecraft, but Minecraft had an early release free version called Minecraft Classic.  It's fair to say that Minecraft Classic and the full release bare little resemblance to each other, but as a public free pre-alpha it did help build the very basic physics of player movement and placing blocks, as well as build excitement for the game through screenshots and videos of amazing creations.

My idea would be to release a free version that has nothing but the DCPU powered ship in a arbitrary environment with one planet and star to navigate around.  It doesn't need to be a random or infinite environment. It could be the same small universe repeating as u reach the edge.  It wouldn't even need multiplayer.  The point of it would be to provide an official DCPU emulator in an environment that makes sense.  A place to let people play with the ships controls and create cool software that would be functional in the real game.  The fact that so may DCPU emulators and software are starting to pop up is great, but none of these emulators or programs will be able to interact with the ships controls, sensors, and displays.  Maybe make it posible to spawn multiple ships so we can experiment with inter-ship communications and networking.  Getting a fully featured emulator in the hands of as many people as possible is a good way to insure a large and functional software library when the paid release comes out.  By releasing a free version that is little more than an emulator so the programming gurus can play with it, you would ensure that the paid version is a more fun experience for the non-programmatically inclined. It would even help to build excitement for the game as interesting and exciting creations start to pop up on the internet.",True,Let's get organized: here's my suggestions + a list of current threads
"**Edit: We've set up some *official forums*! ~~If you want to participate in the project, get in touch by going to *#0x10c-dev* on freenode! (We don't link the forum here to avoid the reddit hug of death).~~**

Hello guys!

So, a great development effort has started for bringing our dream vision of 0x10c to life. However, this subreddit makes for a bad place to get organized. This thread hopes to change that for the better by proposing a few ideas on how to get organized and by listing all current threads in this subreddit that are related to this game's development.

There are a few important points to consider:

 · We all come from all around the world. While the majority of people here is probably from the US, we still have very different time zones.

 · Reddit is a good place for news and discussion, but not for project management.

 · We have a lot of people with very different interesting ideas, and we don't want them to get lost in a battle of upvotes.

Here is my proposal:

 1. We decide a codename for our project, then someone can set up a forum (based on phpBB or SMF). We should move there for all project management discussions, such as design choices and team building, but we shouldn't abandon this place as it will always be a good place to get other people involved.

 2. Most of us would like to talk about the game in a more immediate fashion. There's already an IRC channel on freenode for that, but we should keep in mind what I said before in regard to different time zones. No collective decisions should be taken in the IRC channel, but rather in the forums.

 3. After we have a forum set up, we should start building the team. We've already started doing it here, but it's a very confusing task. I suggest bringing the current list over in the forum, and then continue organization there.

 4. Once we start building the team, we need two key roles that are still missing: a lead designer and a team manager. They can be the same person, but not necessarily. If you have experience as a designer and you think you have time and dedication for this, make sure to get noticed! 

On safety precautions:

 · We should get some safety precautions in case something goes wrong, for example: the forum organizer goes mad and the forum blows up. Every member of the team should have all other members' email addresses, so that we can quickly rebuild ourselves. We should always keep backups of everything important.

That's all I have to suggest for now. Be sure to comment if you have any other ideas.
When we get a forum set up, I would like to help with community moderation and design, if possible.

"It's very old and disappointingly useless, but after the recent influx of links to other space games, I thought we ought to remember that we CAN play 0x10c, a little bit... It's the old leak from long ago, not much to see here but at least it's something:

http://0x10c-france.fr/download/0x10c_leak.zip

If you haven't tried it, give it a go; it probably won't work on your computer and even if it does it's just a keyboard-input-taking screen and some shapes in a dark room with no physics. I just thought 0x10c itself in the most updated (only) form we have would be better than just posting other space games and links to other subs all day. Just unzip it and run 0x10c.bat; it might work and it might spew shader errors in the console. It runs on my laptop w/ Intel 2630QM and GeForce 540GT, but not my desktop w/ Core 2 extreme QX9650 and Radeon HD 4890.

"So, I just thought about a few things which would be cool to do in terms of ship mechanics. You can see this document as a mix of 'would-be-nice-if-we-had'-rambling and gameplay-suggestion. Mojang, if you read this, feel free to steal any ideas!

First of, I'd imagine that every player would only get one ship to run at the same time in the same universe. Maybe with the option to start from scratch, and maybe the possibility of obtaining more at the expense of some obscene amount of effort/in-game-currency (eg. 'bribe the ship-licenser with 100 tons of diamonds')
This limitation would be in place to prevent players from simply switching their ship around according to the situation or to quickly gain advantage trough numbers without actual player cooperation.

--- **Building the ship** ---

So now you have your one, abstract ship and want to actually build it / modify your initial-starting model.
I don't think we can go the Minecraft route, because having a ship build out of voxels would be simultaneously to detailed for ship-physics, and to undetailed for nice spaceship designs. Also, Notch has already started that he has something else based around plain-colored polygons in mind.

So, here's my Idea how ship building could work:
First, your ships basic structure is defined by building it out of several modules that are connected to each other, similar to how for example the ISS is build.


*  Bulkheads: 
The majority of your ships structure would consist of them. They are three-dimensional convex rooms of arbitrary integer size. For example, you could have a long 4x4x20 corridor in the middle of your ship, with four 6x3x10 rooms to the sides. Bulkheads would come in 3 complexities with increasing cost, but also increasing build freedom:

   
  *  'square':    only 90° angles allowed. Combined with the convex-restriction pretty much means 'cuboid'
  *  'octagonal': 45° angles allowed.
  *  'hexadecagonal': 22.5° angles allowed.
  

  The reason for this is, that on the one hand you have a simple system of connected boxes, which makes physics checking easier, while on the other hand still allowing for a reasonable amount of freedom. 16 different angles are enough to build something that looks like a circle, and the visible polygon-i-nes would fit into Notchs targeted style. Also, It's a lot easier to get different parts of your ship to align if you only have to worry about a finite number of possible combinations.
  
  You can freely mix and match different complexities, for example have a star-shaped ship consisting of 8 square bulkheads with an octagonal bulkhead connecting them in the middle. Every bulkhead has its own light/life support/gravity setting, so your ships structure and personal needs would determine how you can regulate your power consumption. Gravity especially, can be oriented in the direction of any wall at build time.
So beginners could have a planar, rectangular ship layout, while advanced players could build an three dimensional gravity-maze of interconnected bulkheads.

*   Bulkhead connectors: 
   Basically everywhere where two different bulkhead walls run parallel and touch each other, you can make a connection. They can also be of arbitrary size and one of the 3 complexities. For example, if two square bulkheads would run next to each other but at a 45° angle, you would need an octagonal connector. They conduct energy and the ships control systems, and can also be sealed/closed.

*   Ship engine(s):
   To set the ships main thrust vector. It's location would basically determine where the front side and backside of your ship is, however you may have more of them and also have them pointed in different directions.

*   Windows: 
The Ability to add windows to bulkheads. Should work like connectors, in that you can put a window in any wall.

*   Docking port: 
 A standardized port to physically connect two ships together. Both sides can sever the connection anytime, and it should also be possible to share energy and ship-peripherals over it.

*  Devices that interact with the outside, like radio or sensors:
  Every device that explicit interacts with the ships outside would be placed on a wall (or floor/ceiling), the external part pointing outwards, while you'd have the control panel/ship-system-connection inside.


Imagine the bulkhead-building like the wall-placing from The Sims, except in 3D, with every room being a separate entity.

The Next step would be to fill your modules with every object that's necessary for your ship.

*   the Computers/DCPUs
*   the Reactor
*   Standalone Devices/Sensors
*   stairs, ladders, lights, decorations etc

Everything that needs energy is tied to the bulkhead it's placed in. Turn off the bulkheads energy, and everything inside goes dark as well.

Again, imagine placing objects like it works in The Sims.

Finally, after you've got the ships internal structure sorted out, you can optionally decorate the ships exterior with a hull, basically give your ship a skin. That could be cheap, decorative plastic panels, or actual armor plating that would increase your ships defenses. The Game would take care to prevent you from blocking windows/engines with hull plates, and things like sensors or antennas could be automatically or manually be moved to be on the hull instead of being covered by it.

Imagine the Spore vehicle/spaceship editor, except that you're building something around your modules.

--- **Building superstructures** ---

Another reason for the fixed-angle-restriction is that you can easily build ships that can reliably connect to other ships at multiple points at once, and also can connect to different ships at the same time. The idea behind is to give players the ability to connect many ships together to, for example, form a big space station, or a big spaceship. Every player would remain in full control over his individual ship, especially in regard to things like its engines/tractor beams/computer etc. Every player could control on a per docking-port basis whether to share energy, their computers, or other devices. Two Examples:

*   3 Players combine their ships into one. 
 
  * One of them assumes the role of the navigator/captain, having full computer-guided control over the three sets of engines.
  * The second one would be in control of weapons, of which the more powerful ones could be used because there would be thrice at much energy at disposal.
  * The third one would be in charge of most computers, and can use them to manage communications, calculate enemy weapon trajectories, monitor space etc.


*  Around 20 players form a space station.
 * They could provide a place for other players to park their ships, and get paid for guarding them.
  * Or they could serve as a bank/warehouse for other players.
  * All station systems would have to be centrally connected. Special care would have to be taken to match up every ships thrust vectors for navigation.
  * The high amount of DCPUS would allow for some fancy calculations.
  * Likewise, 20 times the energy would mean you could cover the station in high-energy defense weapons.
  * The players would have to build with redundancy in mind, so that an attack that takes out critical sections wouldn't doom the whole station.
  * Rouge ships, who for example suddenly start their engines while docked and change the course of the station would have to be identified and either disconnected, or steered against to provide neutral thrust.
  * The station would have enormous offensive/Defensive capabilities, but would also be weak against sabotage due to its complexity.

"So I was thinking, and surely I can't be the only one, that skills like welding, soldering (maybe that's a bit overkill, but you catch my drift), painting on metal and many many more would be a nice addition to the game.

Most of them would not really have a place in the game, but I really think that welding should be in the game to at least some extent. For last minute repairs or making a repair shop on a space station. It could even be extended with the DCPU to make repair drones or automated repair stations.

Soldering would be quite cool too, so you can make your own hardware, of course with boundaries. Even though I don't think this is a realistic goal to set for a game, I still like the idea. But I suppose wiring will function a bit like soldering.

Painting on metal says it all. Good for navigation in big ships, and you can also customize your own ship's exterior.

Some of these suggestions might have been written before, but I really suck at searching for posts on Reddit. :(

But what do you think, would you cut or extend some of these ideas? Maybe scrap them as a whole?



Edit: Let me build a scenario or two, now I have some more time.

Simply imagine a carrier, with let's say 8 small ships, all needing a single pilot. In the hangar of the carrier, there could be two players functioning as the roles of engineers. These players can tweak, overclock, repair and even upgrade parts of the ships very efficiently and fast compared to other players. These tweaks could go for everything from the engine(s) to the weapons. All these tweaks and upgrades could be done to the larger carrier ship too. Even though all the ships would be the same stock fighter, they have all been customized by their pilots, so they can easily identify eachother. 
*While I do fear that this could easily translate to a ""push button, get bacon"" mechanic without mini-games (I don't want to scrap this idea, but I find it far from ideal), I do also think it could give more player roles in multiplayer.*

Another scenario: You just bought a new ship from a player, but aren't quite satisfied with the armor plating around the vital parts of the ship. Being the skilled engineer you are, you equip your welder and begin to weld armor plating onto the ship. While this adds to the total weight of the ship, it adds to it's durability, a price you are willing to pay.",1351963463.0,How about hardware speech synthesis?

"If the DCPU-16 was from the late 80s, why is its CPU speed listed as only 100kHz? For comparison, a Commodore 64 (1982) runs at 1Mhz, an MSX (1983) runs at 3.6MHz, a Gameboy (1989) runs at 4MHz. It also uses an extremely low-res proprietary monitor, which is strange for something that's supposed to be the most popular machine on the market.

"I was thinking how fun it would be to eventually get teleportation technology in 0x10c.

Your man at the console starts inputting how many number of teleporter platforms will activate [2], as well as the X Y Z destination co-ordinates, that will depict how far away from each teleporter pad you'll be sent (to an enemy ship or planet!). A sensor system could be used to display information to allow the console user to make a calculated teleport guess.

 Imagine the excitement of successful teleportation, appearing on the enemey ship, ready to strike... or the gut wrenching failure seeing you've just been teleported, or sent friends into to cold vacuum of space!

For the ballsy solo pilots, a 10 second teleport delay could be used (like taking a picture with a camera) as well as countdown to your return would also be really exciting. Overcalculating your stay and having to survive long enough on an enemy ship to safely teleport back, or give yourself just enough time to hit and run?

"I know Notch is going for a minimalist approach with the DCPU, but at times I feel like what the system can do is limited by the display. I think that it would be reasonable to have an alternative 80x25 monitor with more detailed letters, but without customizable fonts and more limited colours (possibly B&amp;W). I think this is a fair trade off for the larger display. Since this monitor would be text-oriented, the blink bit would instead be used for an 8-bit character set.",False,"Will there be hardware for measurements (sensors) for things such as velocity, magnetism, gravitational pull or light?

It is pretty safe to assume that the DCPU will allow interfacing with the ship's weapons, but will its capabilities extend further than that? Will it allow accurate measurements of things outside the ship's control? Will we get more non-standard methods of communication?

"Hey everyone - hope you had a good Christmas.  Just a quick update, new version of DevKit can be downloaded from the site, http://0x10c-devkit.com/ .

The app was updated to use some newer tech for the build process, and creating a setup/installer is what pushed things back by a week or two.  So, change of plan, it's a .zip you 
extract somewhere, and it will automatically offer to associate with solution files on startup ;)  You might want to uninstall the old version first.

Some release notes, what's new and changed:

* Now powers http://0x10c-cloud.com/ - some changes under the hood, including solutions having Loadouts in them.  Should have tighter integration in the future!
* Implements the official vector display tech (existing one was a placeholder created a good few months before the official one)
* Implements the official disk drive tech (as above)
* Extra error output when building with dcputoolchain, though see note about version of DTCC used
* Fixed HWI errors found from fuzz testing
* Fixed some backwards compatibility for pre-1.7.5 project building
* Fixed opengl memory problems
* Fixed cycle timer bug
* Can optionally choose to close startup window automatically
* Switched to better error reporting component

I had meant to spend some time today getting the latest DCPUToolchain/C compiler integrated in there, but the docs for getting going with the ""new"" version - well new since I last 
looked about 6 months ago at least! ;) - are down I think (http://dcputoolcha.in/docs / http://dcputoolcha.in/tutorial/index.html ?).  So that will follow.  When that happens, Code Pad on the cloud site will support C too.  Other than that, any problems, let me know, or pop something on the GitHub issues page.

Obviously things have slowed down a fair bit, for 0x10c stuff in general.  With the ""cloud"" site out there and devkit up-to-date, I like to think there's a potential platform for building some cool features and ideas as/when/if anything happens, and without a flurry of new functionality to play with, I figure that's going to be more beneficial focus for energy for the future..

In fact, in general - has anyone else got something cool in the works?  The Toolchain IDE is on the go still right - that started to come together pretty quick last I looked?  libmalp (IIRC) was the idea for a simulated DCPU-driven robot, also sounds fun.  I had the idea for hosting some DCPU processes, or maybe those MALPs for live coding battles or something but couldn't think of an angle to make it compelling..

Alright - have a good evenin', seeya ;)",False,Is this how Space Travel is going to look/feel like?
0,False,The human aspect
"The technical aspects of this game have been discussed a lot, but what about the human ones? Will we have to eat and sleep, or would you like the game to focus solely on the technical aspects?

I hope that some type of nutritional system is implemented where you have to make sure you keep your health up by eating properly and rotating your eating habits. 

It would warrant things like kitchens, (massive, inefficient, bulky and rare) food replicators, water treatment plants, etc. It would make the ship seem more alive and less sterile, make co-operative play more challenging due to increased need for food and create a demand for seeds and similar items in-game.

Something as simple as minecraft's hunger system would probably not work, but I would love to have something to play around with in my downtime like creating a good farming system or creating my own recipes. 

Perhaps something along the lines of Oblivion's alchemy system would work within the context of the game and have various rare plants available to find and use to create food with special effects.

What about you? How would you like to see the human element implemented in the game?",False,How could hacking work in 0x10c?
"The post about malicious software the other day got me thinking about whether hacking would actually be possible in 0x10c. Sci-fi would have you believe that in order to take over another space ship all you need to do is obtain their (pretty simple) command codes and boom their ship is in your control. I don't think it will quite be as simple as running the 'hack' command from afar and sending an enemy's ship flying into a sun. This is why I think that.

Modern day hacking typically involves finding some sort of vulnerability in a computer system. This is pretty easy as the base operating systems are pretty much all standard. Instead of a bank writing their own, they'll use something off the shelf like Windows Server or Linux. On top of this they'll use an off the shelf database such as MySQL or Oracle. Then, on top of this their bespoke banking application will run. Pretty much all vulnerabilities are in these standard off the shelf systems rather than the bespoke applications running on top of them. The reason why is because hackers have access to this software too, so they can test vulnerabilities on their own machines, then use what they find against a target. Heck, the manufactures of these even tell people what the vulnerabilities are (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2757760) to try to get them to install patches to fix them!

Viruses are similar, in that they take into account known vulnerabilities and expose them. However, rather than a hacker doing something to install them, typically they are installed by an action performed by the user of a target system. Given modern day general purpose computers, running all sorts software from different vendors, it is pretty common to have various security holes in your computer. Most people who get viruses (e.g. your parents :rolleyes:) aren't really that tech savy and don't know that you shouldn't click links offering you £1,000,000, open files from unknown sources, keep your system up to date, etc.

The DCPU will be different though. It won't be running a standardised operating system (you'll probably end up writing it yourself), and it won't be running a multitude of services which talk to the outside world. Apart from most software not being that standardised, I think the size of the programs will be so small that it'll actually be possible to write software without any security vulnerabilities. Without standardised software, hacking won't be anywhere as easy like it is with computer systems today. Oh and I didn't even talk about the networking (or lack thereof) side of things...

So, how could hacking work? I would really like to see it in the game, but I just can't see how it would work. This is my question for you /r/0x10c as I'm pretty stumped. Here are a few things I've come up with, but I don't really think they are that feasible:

* Notch leaves some sort of backdoor into every spacecraft / radio / DCPU / etc. Given that this would be known about pretty quickly, I think it'll be pretty easy to write software (on the DCPU) to work around this.

* A compiler adds some sort of backdoor into every binary (by stephenkall in the other thread)",False,See the SPED-3 in action

"We all know now that with open tracts of space, the only way to transmit data is through electromagnetic radiation:  radio waves and the like.  However, these put out signals to everyone, and there may be a group of hungry space pirates listening in on you and your friend's chat about where to store your stash of enriched Einsteinium.  To get secure information, you need some way to make sure your information can't get into the hands of those you don't want it to, at least not in a state that they can read it.

To accomplish that, we have cryptography.  Cryptography is an awesome math thing that uses one-way equations to create a code that can scramble a message ""Hello world"" into ""16B3CD9A880B4FF703"" or something.  Then you also have a code that can unscramble this message, effectively creating a secret language, if you will, between two parties.  With this, even if a bunch of pirates get your code, it's gibberish without the decryption key.

I predict that cryptography will be a necessary part of all serious communications in 0x10c.  It's too important not to have, and too cool for some computer nerds not to make.  Someone has probably already made a crypto program already, actually.

What do you guys think?  Is there a problem with RSA or other public key encryption that could pose problems (for instance, the legality of cryptography and how it's considered a weapon by the US government and is tightly regulated)?",False,How will planet surface rendering be handled?
"I've just recently started following the development for 0x10c. 

I was wondering, has there been any indication towards how planet surfaces and such are going to be handled? Will we be given pre-designed structures to explore, or will locations be rendered based on algorithms similar to minecraft?

I was thinking it would be cool if planets are formed similar to how minecraft is now, with a grid system made up of blocks, except instead of the worlds being flat the grid would be placed on a spherical overlay.

The potential for creating environments similar to Minecraft mixed with a full space trader would be amazing.

0,False,More Controllers for the DCPU...
"So I was thinking about what else needs to be added to make the ships feel more like the 80's vision of spaceships, and less like floating boxes, and I came to controllers.

 It would be cool to have a non-keyboard controller, accessible on screen, with a couple of sliders, dials (maybe and x:y pad or two) and a couple of displays, that we could bind functions/vars/scripts to. 

Maybe in terface where we could write a code, for example, that tells the dcpu to set a certain variable, or memory position, to a certain statem depending on the state of a toggle, or we could use a code to tell the controller to light up a lamp on the virtual dash under certain conditions (e.g. the engines stop responding to commands, or if certain doors open). Some degree of customisation would  be nice, so everyone could have a different dash, and one of the perils of hacking someones ship would be working out how to fly the damn thing.

The last idea, which might sound better in my head than out loud, but would be an (optional) ios/android app, that would functions a a touchscreen version of your dash, or a portion of your dash, so you could set up your iphone or ipad next to your keyboard, and be able to set thrusters to 95% drive (or whatever) with a touch of a finger...

"calculating real time physics for logged out people constantly would be a massive waste of server resources. 

how about this idea, ""logging out"" is in the game world means activating a device that stores all the information of your ship and converts you and it into a special collapsed form of sub-atomic particle.

what this means? your undetectable, untouchable, ect... your not there anymore effectively... the one downside is that this process takes about 2-3 minutes IRL to do... (scanning and storing the information about your ship.

so you might be asking where your ship appears when you log in?

well your a sub atomic particle, so you have to obey quantum physics (or close enough to fit in with the game, you don't want to spawn inside a planet)

when you spawn you have a probability to spawn anywhere within the orbital pattern you became part of, (which is determined by the total energy of your ship when you logged out.)

and as part of the device you decide the shape of the orbital you join, within energy constraints...

also you have to be in orbit around something to log out.

"I read a comment thread yesterday from around a week ago about MIDI controllers and Notch's goal to support them in game. So I went on a hunt for virtual MIDI controllers that are Android and iOS based. Here are two apps that I thought would work well with the game.

* For iOS: [SonicLogic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SaKsaGwzg8&amp;feature=plcp)

* For Android: [TouchOSC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexler.touchosc&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5oZXhsZXIudG91Y2hvc2MiXQ..)

TouchOSC is a free app that is very basic but flexible, but I think SonicLogic will be better because of its customizability as shown in the video. Either way, I really hope that MIDI will indeed be supported when the game comes out.

0,False,On 0x10c's Economy
"So Notch has mentioned that the game will have an economy.  I wonder if anyone else has been thinking exactly what this economy could be like...

We live in a world where the economy is kind of taken for granted.  We have banks, money, business, and government.  We are born into it, and it's what we are used to.  But in 0x10c, which is basically a bunch of people waking up in a deserted universe, there is no economy.  No banks, no money, only resources.  So what happens here?

* Maybe people simply barter.  ""Hey, dude I have too much hydrogen, give me some of your food supplies and you can have half"".  Might work, but then you have the problem when you want to barter, but you or the other guy doesn't have the thing you need.  Maybe an item with a constant demand (value) could be used as a type of ""currency"" eg water, oxygen, fuel, etc).

* Maybe people will cling to old ways, and try to recreate the old economy.  How would that work... perhaps people would have their own ""private banks"" running on their DCPU in the same way that banks work today (mostly digital).  That would also leave open the possibility of hacking, and give rise to the importance of digital security...

* Or maybe people will find another way, some new, more advanced economy, not held back by the established ways of the old society.  There are plenty of examples of theoretical future economies, post-scarcity, etc.

I guess the main point of this post is; I don't want there to be an economic model already established by the game.  If the economy is created by the players, we could have a much richer experience with possibilities of multiple economies, created, collapsed or outgrown as the players see fit.

I would be willing to contribute to a project that had a working assembler and emulator with a networking/radio device.

I'm working on a simple server application that can accept client connections and map them on an internal 2D plane/grid, and cause interference between clients data by 'distance' on the grid...pretty much emulating a Signal to Noise ratio that is enforced by the middleman.  Your X,Y coordinates are never exposed, so you're left to your own devices to locate anyone else.  There is only a socket, no protocol.  Anything transmitted by one client will be received by all other clients (perhaps mixed in with other sending clients' data too) based on how close you are to the other players.  There are also measurable delays (read: the dcpu is fast enough to process simple triangulation) when communicating with nearby/far players.

Instead of sharding or realms or channels the proximity system handles privacy and spam and such neatly.

"Hi everyone!

What are everyones thoughts on having an opcode reserved especially for debuggers to recognize as break points in a program.

When executing without a debugger, the instruction is simply skipped, however a debugger will be able to recognize that opcode, and pause execution.

The reason it's important that an opcode for this is reserved in the official DCPU spec is to ensure a couple of things:

* All Debuggers have a standard to follow, instead of a different opcode (or breakpoint method) for each debugger
* Ensuring that the opcode isn't later used in the DCPU spec.

A real world counter-part to this opcode would be INT 3. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_(x86_instruction)#INT_3)

INT 3 has it's own opcode, 0xCC, in x86. My suggestion for the opcode would be one of the 'reserved for future expansion' (in the special opcodes section of the spec). Another option would be to use one of the special opcodes, such that debug information can also be passed from the running program to the debugger through the single argument that special opcodes receive.

Hi everyone, I do regular live streams of DCPU development.

This weekend I'm looking at doing a 'DCPU Assembler From Scratch' live stream, starting out with basic concepts of DCPU programming and moving on from there. I will be following the tutorial hosted on 0x10command (http://0x10command.com/dcpu-assembly-tutorials/), giving viewers a chance to ask questions about any parts they aren't understanding.

(Small note: It appears some of the information in those tutorials is out of date).

Also if anyone knows of another set of tutorials, let me know.

I haven't yet chosen a time to do the live stream, so if you're interested in tuning in, please reply here with a time / day (Saturday or Sunday) that you'd find it convenient to view the livestream at (include your timezone! (or better yet, give it to me in GMT+0) ), and I'll try schedule it around a time that most people can tune in.

"So, I was reading Star Citizen's designer's AMA (I posted an ignored comment that was what I hope Star Citizen is as much as I hope 0x10c is). I was thinking about what 0x10c could do about Carriers. Big ships with automated guns, and small-fighter bays. 

A group of 5 to 20 players could move their power supplies to a mobile gun platform with fighter bays and a large stock of rechargeable batteries. 

One captain could maintain the carrier while the fighters go off and run hit-and-run fire until the burn out a battery, drop into the bay, switch out batteries, and get back into battle. 

This could mean for a pretty good excuse to have boarding battles. On modern naval battles, a boarding party is unheard of. If an aircraft even comes close to a flight deck without a good transceiver, it gets cut to shreds. Space battles like Star Wars: Battlefront 2's boarding parties are absolutely absurd. There is no reason a foreign spacecraft should be able to land safely in an enemy ship.

In 0x10c, however, you could give boarding craft short range teleporters (we can teleport through 4d space, so why not?) Instead of letting people teleport from capital ship to capital (could be problematic for balance), a small strike craft that could leach onto a ship could teleport crew through a single bulkhead (eliminating the need to ""cut"" a bulkhead; and all the code/art to make that work).

So what I'm thinking is why don't we write a very tiny C compiler that compiles a subset of C for the DCPU, and write this compiler ONLY in this subset.

Now what are the advantages of this approach?

The compiler would be small enough to run on the DCPU itself, maybe around 50-100 kb TOPS, leaving in the worst case 155kb working memory. This should be enough for the compiler to compile itself on the DCPU.

So what we could do is use the LLVM project to compile this small compiler that compiles a subset of C for the DCPU, and use this optimized compiler to compile other programs on the DCPU.

Write C code and compile it in-game.

Then I had an idea, what if cloaking fields acted as an event-horizon around your ship, making it impossible for anything including light to escape? That provides a neat explanation for how your ship is invisible to other players, and prevents cloaked players from teleporting (or whatever) to your ship without dropping the cloak.


It could also be used to trap other players on your ship, who'd then have to either hack your DCPU or destroy the cloaking generator to escape.

"So, here's a kind of physics/speculation-on-random-explanation thread.  This time, it's about gravity and how it works on space-ships.

So far, we've seen that the player can fall downwards perpendicularly to the ship's floor.  This leads us to believe that there is a force keeping the player on the ground.  We can assume 1 of 3 things:

1)  The ship accelerating upwards.  While there is a possibility that there are rocket thrusters constantly accelerating the ship upwards in respect to the floor, this seems unlikely, as there has been no visible change in the ship's view of the outside (the planets in the videos Notch has released were not starting to fly out of view downwards).  Thus, this is not very likely.

2)  The ship is actually ring-shaped, is spinning, and is exerting apparent centrifugal force on the outside.  Since we haven't seen this in the architecture of the ships OR the outside view, this is improbable too.  Which leaves us with only one really good explanation:

3) SCIENCE.  Or witchcraft.  Anyways, engineers from the 80's somehow managed to create localized gravity field generator, which is part of the ship.  This somehow bends spacetime to pull you down to the floor of the ship, but not make the ship do weird physics stuff that might come with distorting the fabric of space and time (such as imploding, disintegrating, warping into higher dimensions, etc.)

"Notch said that you and your ship will respawn in a 'parallel universe' (it's not really a parallel universe, it's just you respawning, as humour).

So basically you never die and neither does your ship. I really dislike this. The respawning of the player is fine, it can be done like EVE's with the whole pod system, but I really dislike that your ship is respawned as is. A huge part of games like these that many people love is the thrilling experience that you can lose your ship and you risk it all the time. It's what makes battles intense and fulfilling.

Edit: Also I'm talking about your physical ship, not the character. You could retain software or something, like in a pod, similar to how EVE retains your skill points and such, but your ship is ultimately destroyed.

What my approach would be since this is a hard scifi approach to the game:

You have a ship that you own, you have software and whatnot that you own and use on the ship, and whatever else belongs to you, lets say skill points for hypothetical sake. These are 'bound' to your character, you don't lose them when your ship is destroyed. Ships should be destroyed, it makes sense with the hard scifi theme and hell, even the looting feature that is planned. You can salvage and loot ships and so on. However, when you die, your character respawns with all your software and whatever else. You'd perhaps have a pod somewhere where you respawn in with your stored consciousness and stored backup of your software, which you will always keep, but your physical ship is destroyed. This fits in with the hard scifi approach to the game, the mere respawning of ships doesn't and quite frankly is very unappealing.

What's your opinion? Perhaps this is something that can be reconsidered, it's one of the planned features of the game I don't like.

",True,Multiverse culture
"All of this will depend on the ""hard coded"" game play features. Can players have multiple ships, can we build space stations, navigation beacons, etc.

I'm thinking about how we want to shape the overall in game culture. I like EVE Online in that players can be mean nasty pirates, but it seems like anything interesting that happens in the game is from players being mean and nasty. Part of the reason I quit was that outside of the ""secure"" industrial gameplay it seemed like everyone was mean and nasty in game.

I think part of this is that the important civilized side of the game is hard coded and not created by the players. They have no vested interested in protecting their gate system or the large market stations because they are hardcoded to never be destroyed. Anything players create only benefit the player or their corp/alliance.  There is no global utility. There are some exceptions (ISS and CVA back in the day), but overall destroying another player's work has no negative effect on the attacker. 

I strongly believe that there is a place for that in 0x10c, but we also have the opportunity to create a space for players willing to build up something together. It would be nice if there was just as much news about massive pirate attacks as there is about creating an elaborate market.

One way we can do that is by creating an in game culture were certain actions results is widespread shock and outrage (this is where the role players help shape the world, even if people like me are not interested in rping). 

Babylon 5 had hyperspace jump gates. Even if a race was at war with another it was an unthinkable atrocity to destroy their hyperspace gates.  It would make everyone turn against them. In 0x10c, assuming we can build space stations with dcpus, I can see us building a galaxy wide internet with space stations housing chat servers, auction servers, and navigation databases with relay stations and satellites bringing the network to all corners of the galaxy. 

Attacking and destroying these could be an unthinkable action.

"A lot of discussion is (naturally) on the DCPU-16, programming and controlling the hardware.

But what about the physics of the game?

Notch has mentioned landing on planets, docking and the likes.
How will this all play out?
Personally, I'm really hoping he doesn't ""cut corners"" to make it an easier/simpler game to play.
I understand the need to keep the playerbase open, but I would be seriously disappointed if Orbital Mechanics weren't considered or applied.
I don't want to be able to point my ship at a planet and arrive there after burning for some time.
I want Hohmann transfers, retro-burns, normal/anti-normal vectors to work.

If you can't tell, I come from KSP. I think they did a wonderful (if not near perfect) job of making a Rocket Science game playable by a non-Rocket Scientist without dumbing it down. Period.

Yes, you have to learn quite a bit to be succesful, but that's what makes it rewarding/satisfying.
I'd prefer this game to have a slight ""elitist"" feel to it. As in you have to actually know what you're doing to succeed.
I really don't want ""Copy and paste code, start DCPU-16, 'LUL MY LAZORS AUTO-TRAK N KLLD U. AUTO-PILOT, TAEK ME TO DIS PLANET TO SEL MAH REEPINGS'"" players.

I'd like to see this game attract and maintain a rather...educated...playerbase.
I'm not saying you aren't allowed to play if you don't know anything about it.
But a game that educates while you play is great. It's something I highly respect Monkey Squad for doing, even if by accident.

0,False,"Networking, the biggest problem and its solution"
"A lot of people seem to be really excited about networking, and they are talking about all the communications that are going to go on between their ship and others and how amazingly cool it will be. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. I'd be very surprised if Notch made transmissions infini-distance, so wireless transmissions would only be able to travel so far. In the real world, this is fine because everything is stationary (or at least within close proximity to a stationary router) and routers are able to maintain tables of who their neighbors are. In this world, that wouldn't happen because nothing stands still in space, so those neighbors will constantly change.

That doesn't, however, mean we can't try to propose a way to extend communications as much as possible. For this, I propose we invent a new type of packet. Basically, this packet is going to have a header containing four things. The first will be a couple bits just to allow other ships to recognize it is a packet, the second and third will be standard destination and source address, and the last will be a random value between 0 and 255 (half of a word, so we can have some kind of identifier in the next 8 bits that let the machine know the data is starting). In the footer, we *might* add a simple checksum because everything is wireless, and I'd say we limit everything in between (the data) to 100 words as to not overload processors.

As far as routing goes, I think the only thing we'd actually be able to implement is a kind of rudimentary system of wireless switches. Basically, in order to use a program that makes use of this packet, you would need a daemon on one of your CPUs that functions as a router (though this could probably be integrated into another program; that's why it's so simple). Any messages received with the starting bits identifying it as a packet will be re-transmitted in all directions, very little thinking involved. If the ship is the receiving end, the daemon won't forward the packet. Afterwards, it'll check for data integrity (if we have some way to check that in the footer), de-capsulate the packet to remove the identifier (saying it's a packet) and the footer, and pass it to any CPUs/programs on board the ship that have signaled they are looking for packets.

The more technologically advanced of you will probably notice the huge flaw in this idea. Taking into consideration everything I explained, the system would be INCREDIBLY prone to routing loops. Packets would also never die. To solve this, we have the routing daemon check everything but the data of the packet, and store the information about each packet into a temporary table along with a timer. These values will decay over a certain amount of time, but while they are in the table, and packet with identical characteristics (including random value) will be thrown out to enable a kind of split horizon system. 

Security, obviously very unsecure in this iteration of the idea, would really be the job of the program receiving individual packets. There are few restrictions on data, so that should be able to be encrypted easily. At the same time, while standards for addressing could probably be very useful (and maybe it'd be nice to implement a kind of MAC address to use as an IP for completely unique identifiers if Notch adds that functionality to the ships) at the moment addressing is very relaxed to allow for manipulation based on what a particular program needs. Maybe it's a chat service, and rather than sending a message to each individual participant, the chat room designates a random broadcast address that's sent out to chatters and kept track of by the clients to ensure only one transmission has to be sent out for each message.

0,False,Scientific Explanations
"I got bored so I figured I would make a list of possible scientific explanations for the various pieces of technology in 0x10^c:

Let's start with propellantless, energy-based engines:

**Alcubierre drive (Warp Drive)** Warp drive is a theoretical concept that would be physically possible. It working contracting space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind it. The cool thing about this is the rules of special relativity do not apply since the ship would be stationary within a ""warp bubble"" between the warped space-time. Scientists have theorized that it could be accomplished by expanding the 11th dimension in front of the ship and shrinking it behind the ship creating dark energy. http://news.discovery.com/space/warp-drive-spaceship-engine.html This is a fairly decent explanation of how warp drive would work.

**Field Drives** Field drives are another cool type of ""engine"". These are not dissimilar to the warp drive except instead of contracting and expanding space-time it folds space time to create a sort o artificial gravity field. This can be done in a few ways, the diametric drive, for example would have an artificial positive mass in front of the ship and an artificial negative mass behind the ship creating negative gravity - a pushing force - behind it and positive gravity - a pulling force in front of it. There are types of field drives you can read about here: http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/1997-J_AIAA_SpaceDr.pdf These field drives would of course not be superluminal.

Now let's look at energy sources, Notch said that it would be a fixed amount of energy and we would not need fuel. Now I would say that leaves us with solar power, but that may be tricky in a dying universe:

**Zero-Point Energy** Zero-point energy is a controversial subject that borders on pseudo science but recently there have been promising breakthroughs. Zero-point energy is the idea of harnessing the background energy fluctuation that exists everywhere. if you were to remove everything from the universe there would still be resonant energy known as ""quantum vacuum energy"" that would still exist. The amount of energy that exists in this ""quantum vacuum"" is huge (10^36 to 10^70 J/m^3) and if we can tap into even a fraction of it, we could probably power a warp drive. There is more info at these links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy
http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050170447_2005172301.pdf (pg 65)

This sort of energy source could be used to explain just about any piece of technology that require much more energy than achievable today.

**TL;DR** Much of the technology that would need scientific explanation can be easily explained through warp drive, field drives, and Zero Point Energy

**Edit:** As [GreyTheory](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/sih6t/scientific_explanations/c4eio7p) pointed out, these scientifically valid hypotheses and not true ""explanations"" for the futuristic technology. However I feel that they are some of the most ""scientifically valid hypotheses"" that can be made for the futuristic technology that would exist in 0x10^c",True,Notch finally adds what we always wanted in Minecraft to a game that ISN'T MINECRAFT!

"I have been looking at some open-sourced solutions around github. I don't have the time with school and such at the momment, but I would be very interested in working on a project like this until notch can break through his creative block. 

I think something like this could inspire new interest in the DCPU development community and it could become a very enjoyable game. We would employ all devices common with 0x10c and likely introduce our own as well.

It this possible? Once Notch defines radio specs (and defines range limitations and such), could we have a internet-like system? Maybe using a relay network of some kind? Will the game support space stations running their own DCPU? 

I assume we'd probably end up coming up with our own web-standard (because HTML would be a horrible idea for the screen we have). We'd have to write a browser and a server (but that doesn't seem TOO hard once radio specs are up). Getting a relay system to work might be a challenge, since basically we'd be created a 16bit IP standard from scratch (right?).

So, is this a horrible idea filled with security flaws, or the best way to communicate and distribute software to beyond the stars?

"I know some people don't think we should make suggestions at this point. But I don't think simply discussing ideas does any harm.

So as the title says, the ability to capture and reprogram robots found on derelict ships. Perhaps they would only be battery powered, so they wouldn't need to be hooked up to the generator.

It would be good to have a defense robot on board while you are logged off. Program him to patrol around the ship and shoot anything it sees. Perhaps it would need some ability to id its owner/allies.

Thanks StonedDataStorage.",True,Am I the only one who's worried about the apparent low resolution of the in-game computer screens? It looks like 32 x 12 characters on a 128 x 96 resolution screen.
"Take a look at this screenshot for reference: https://twitter.com/#!/notch/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FKVgLRq7o

If I'm counting correctly, that's a 128 x 96 pixel screen, allowing 32 x 12 characters. That's way too low, IMHO. You can't do all that much with a screen that small.

For comparison, [here's a Commodore 64 screenshot from 1982](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/C64_startup_animiert.gif/260px-C64_startup_animiert.gif).

The Commodore 64 / 128 (which obviously inspired the computer screens in 0x10c) allowed 40 x 25 characters on the screen, which is a lot better than 0x10c's 32 x 12.

I was hoping to be able to make some sort of communication software similar to 1980's style BBSes.

0,False,My plans and why I am excited for 0x10c
"Just to give a background, I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student and I'm one of the programmers for [Star Sonata 2](http://starsonata2.com) so I have a lot of experience with both assembly code and what I'll call ""npc spaceship logic programming"".

Being a huge fan of both space MMOs and low level programming I'm extremely excited at the thought of 0x10^c and the possibility of programming a fleet of ships with a ""swarm"" behavior.  We of course do not know many of the smaller details of the game as it is likely that Notch has not even thought that far ahead, but I believe we know enough to start making plans.  I'm looking for feedback on my rough plan below and I'm mostly looking for flaws that I have overlooked.


Assumptions (Notch has not explicitly stated any of this but based on what he seems to be going for I'm thinking):

* The DCPU will be able to control most/all ship systems
* There will be some form of networking possible between DCPUs on the same ship
* DCPUs will be able to access some sort of comm system, allowing some form of collaboration between ships.
* Comm systems will be inherently insecure, both in that anyone can listen in to your messages and possibly spoof messages.
* There will be DCPU accessible telemetry data (probably just ships/other large objects but if we're lucky we'll be able to get data on projectiles)
* Power will be a very limiting factor on ships, it will not be possible to have weapons firing with shields up (will there be shields?) while running 3+ DCPU and maneuvering etc.

If all these hold true then I believe a swarm strategy is the best way to go.

**Fleet Design**

Drone - Ideally I will come up with a nice balanced ship hardware design that I can mass produce that will be capable of both combat and economic roles to support fleet expansion. If such a ship build is not practical then they will be solely combat ready with a separate subfleet for economic purposes.  They will be capable of basic automation that can be overridden by the command ship which will designate targets.

Command Ship - This is where I will be, it will be as heavily armored/defended as possible and also hold as many DCPUs as I can reasonably fit in one ship without sacrificing defenses.  Early versions will likely have weapon systems when my swarm is small but they can be removed later to accommodate the bank of DCPUs that will be required to control a large swarm of drones.

**Communications**
Secure comms are vital for this to work, some form of rotating/time seeded encryption on comm packets will be essential.  Other options would be implementing some custom form of public key/private key authentication.  Most communication would be from Command -&gt; drone.  Possible exceptions are drones responding to a status request or other specialized ships reporting back with telemetry or other data.  Adding this to the fact that I plan program the system myself I believe it is reasonable to expect my comms to remain secure.

**Upgrades**
My fleet will be constantly evolving, and I doubt that I will be content to simply grow my numbers.  Unfortunately I don't see any way to reasonably expect transmitting firmware updates to each ship over comms to be secure so I expect to have to board each ship with a floppy. This will likely be a very time consuming process so it will not happen often.

**Ship Damage**
This, as surprising as it may sound, is what worries me the most about the viability of my plan.  I think it is unlikely that automated repairs will be possible and I'm not sure of the frequency of repairs or how urgent they will be.  This may be one of the biggest limiting factors on crewless ships.

**Drone Design**

* As I said before drones will be as cheap as possible, while still being cost effective.
* Assuming 3 DCPUs per ship I will have the main computer, which will control weapon firing and other offensive actions.  It will have 2 states automatic and under orders from the command ship.  If under orders (simple, such as fire at the designated coordinates or move to a location) and if orders are not received it will revert to automatic. Under automatic it will automatically aquire what it deems to be enemy targets and fire otherwise just hanging near other friendlies.  This will be useful if comms are disrupted for any reason. (ship damage or some sort of comm jamming/overload).  
* 3d movement and targeting calculations require a lot of heavy math, so that is why the 2nd DCPU will be dedicated entirely to math.  It will primarily be utilizing lookup tables but will also be able to do various custom batch calculations (such as determining nearby hostiles from telemetry data, or) It will free up the requesting machine to do other tasks while it waits for the results back.  
* The 3rd DCPU will be the machine responsible for things outside the ship, primarily comms, telemetry, and raising defenses if an immanent threat is detected.  Additionally, the other 2 DCPUs will be setup to trigger a self destruct if access to the comms DCPU is lost for more than a small preset time.  This is because access to my source would be a major security risk as a big part of my security will be through the uniqueness of it and the source being unavailable.

**Command Ship Design**

* This is where I will reside in my fleet, this is an obvious risk but I will only have such a ship if extremely heavy armor/sheilding is possible.
* The following dcpu/terminals are listed in the order of importance, I do not expect to be able to have all of them and the ones lower in the list will be integrated into others if possible.
* Main computer, this is where all direct control over the ship will happen and where I will be able to manually fly the ship as well as designate orders to my drones.  When I am not actively controlling it, it is capable of giving basic orders to drones to keep the fleet cohesive. Not much will be running here as I need it to be as responsive as possible.
* Comms/telemetry, recieves orders from the main computer to send out to drones as it's primary goal.  Also handles all telemetry and any information flowing in and out of the ship.
* Math DCPU, same as in the drones but might even need 2 this time.  I expect massive amounts of objects to process all of which need to be analyzed in 3dimensional space.
* My workstation, for me to tink with and prepare code to use everywhere else.  Won't be powered on all the time if that would cause any issues but I think a dedicated machine to experiment on while not disrupting important machine's functions is very important.
* ""Cyber Warfare"" station, in it's passive state it will just be collecting comms traffic of other ships. I will be monitoring all community program's and I will try to have methods to compromise the copied software that most ships will be running ready if possible. Might possible make a way for it to cycle through various ""hacks"" automatically if I tell it to?  Hacking a new system in the middle of battle is not realistic but using this machine I plan to have as many premade hacks ready to fly at the touch of a button.
*Database, hopefully we will have largish (MB range) storage possible and this is where I will try to have as much as possible.  This DCPU will get data feeds from all other sources I can get for centralization/display.  Will hopefully have this hooked up to a display so that I can have it passively focus on displaying it in a meaningful way.

"I just thought I'd put forward my idea about a system of leveling the playing field in multiplayer. Basically, the problem with a lot of sandbox multiplayer games (like minecraft) is that people that have been playing for longer can too easily defeat newer players.

My idea works on the basis of a radar system. Everyone's radar can pick up larger objects from greater distance, while small objects can only be detected in a small distance. Makes sense.

Small ships (presumably less powerful) will be able to avoid contact with larger ones because of the radar detection range. Larger ships on the other hand, will have to pick fights with enemies closer to their own size.

Of course, the concept only works if the size of ships roughly equal their power. It would have to be expensive if not impossible to get ship parts that are powerful for the space they take up.

Many of us are planning to make programs for the DCPU-16, but even planning is difficult because we know so little. For example, will it come with a built-in OS? Communication software? Or will players have some other way of communicating with eachother, without using the in-game computers? Having answers to questions like this would make it easier for us to plan ahead.

I knew it probably wouldn't be of much value to the community when I started, as there are loads of tools out there already, probably most of which are better than mine, but I'm really glad I did it.

It's helped me understand a massive amount of how everything works, and I would definitely recommend that everyone have a go at creating one, particularly those with no assembler experience but experience in other higher level languages.

My effort is [here](http://0x10c.liam-galvin.co.uk/) if you want to have a look. It's still lacking a few features but I'm enjoying debugging and altering it so I'll probably add on a virtual screen and keyboard, and a disassembler soon too. It assembles and runs Notch's example code correctly, but I'm sure there are still a few bugs in there, so criticism is welcome if you see something not quite right!

",False,We need to set up some priorities.
"Ok guys, we need to put some priorities out there. I have some priorities that I think we should establish now so we can function in the multiverse:

* People were saying they didn't want to have a huge alliance for redditors, because games like EVE are more fun without them. But, almost everyone agreed that we should have some sort of guild to protect newbies. Well, when the first explorers begin to wake up from deep sleep, we'll *all* be newbies. I think for the first week or so everyone should work together to establish alliances and an economy (more on that later).

* A chat network. I'm pretty sure Notch won't be putting any ship-to-ship chat in the game, so when the first players log in and wake up, no one will be able to communicate with each other. Baked into the 0x42c OS and any other OS thats released for the DCPU-16, there needs to be ONE kind of chat software, so everyone who's read up on the game can communicate right when they install the OS on their first ship's computer. An evolution of this would be an email client and server.

* An economy. Sure, trading goods is great, but an economy with money can be better. It would be less confusing, and all the materials could have a value in the currency, so conversion can happen. I suggest Trillek for the name of the currency if thats not how it turns out you pronounce 0x10c.

* With a currency, you can set up a banking system, so people can transfer money to each other and borrow money from the bank, and earn intrest on their money. I think that the person who writes the banking software will be very wealthy in-game.

If we start these projects early, then hopefully no one will have a chance to start up a competing standard, and at least for the first week of play or so everyone will be on the same page.",False,Notch planning on adding text-to-speech output for the CPU

In case it is a single player game, every little journal, map, screenshot or even a picture of your duck, that you insert into the game, may appear in another one's universe (kinda like dark souls) and he may interact with them and place them on the walls, keep them in his inventory or even destroy them.If its a MMO, it would be nice to read scary stories from r/nosleep near the fire of a burning ""Hambeast"". I love writing stories and I love reading them to other people. I would love landing on an asteroid to find a crazy man's diary about how he spend his day on Ghoulwhild hunting for ""Cunterlopes"".

Any thoughts on this r/0x10c?",False,I don't have a twitter account so hopefully Markus will see my question here:  Will we be able to run our own 0x10c servers?  
"If this question has been asked before I apologise, I promise I looked for it.

I'd like to know how Mojang/Markus feels about this.  Would you be opposed to it as it would circumvent users paying for subscriptions to your MMO service?  Would it add a level of complication that you don't want to work into the game?  

I would like to have a personal server to play with close friends and family, and I would like the ability to install mods that take away things like FTL travel and restrict all players to a single star system.  I want trips between celestial objects to take days, weeks or even months.  I want communication speeds limited to c. I think it would be interesting to wake up in an unknown star system that needs to be explored.  I would like to build new ships and satellites out of the raw materials I find there.  I think it would be fascinating to build an interplanetary communication network and maintain it (hardware/software failures, asteroid collisions, running out of fuel and burning up in orbit around a planet, etc).

Of course, the problem with what I'm saying is it's all just stuff that ""I want"" or what ""I think"" would be cool.  I know it's not my place to tell Mojang what to with their game.  However, my imagination has the best of me at the moment and so I would like to know.",False,Black Holes
"So with Notch semi-throwing away hard science. This opens up new possibilities for black holes. 

Scientifically, a black hole will kill you if you go beyond the event horizon (and a bunch of other weird stuff we don't fully comprehend), but in-game they could be used as wormholes teleporting you to another part of the galaxy. It could be a form of quick travel, if Notch doesn't allow FTL drives. 

According to the story black holes dominate the galaxy, so I assume they will play a fairly big role in the game. It would be kind of cool if they were more than just ""game over screens"". 

Thoughts?",False,"Luddites, unite!"
"I think that everything about this game sounds awesome, including DCPU-16. But it seems like all of the other awesome aspects of the game, namely the exploration, trade, and combat, are all overshadowed by the programming of DCPU-16. To people who are not as good at programming, the threat of viruses, remote ship control, and other such complications is overwhelming and frightening.

So, I was thinking that it might be interesting to forego the computer completely. That is, if the game provides options for manual control of your ship in every aspect, I would never turn my computer on; instead I would upgrade my single ship's other gear and fly it through space under my own control. I think it would be fun and sort of exciting to form a group that spurns the in-game technological advances, just trying to stay alive and make ends meet in the universe, looking out for one another.
 
Anyone else want to be a luddite?",False,"Simple ""pre-emptive"" OS"
"I was thinking about the possibilities of how an OS on the DCPU would work. As we now know, it does not (and likely will not) have interrupts. This may mean (correct me if I'm wrong) that it will have to use some form of cooperative multitasking.

But then how do we prevent programs from either maliciously or accidentally dominating computer time?

What if the OS inspects the program code each time before it hands off control to ensure that the program calls back to the OS? Potentially, the OS could even inject a call back to itself into the program before running it.

I know there are all sorts of loopholes and traps, I'm just throwing this out there to see what you guys think.

As great as reddit is for sharing new links/information, old information gets lost far too easily. It would be preferable to have a forum setup, such as phpBB, for community management and use. I can host/setup/manage a forum for the community.

If you want a forum, I need two things: a name for the game so I can get a relevant domain and a general consensus that a forum is the route we want to take to keep the community organized through the years of development. 

In the interest of openness and data integrity, I can set up a database push with all public posts for community download (nothing from the user table, etc.)... But again, only if the community wants it.

Edit: Some details of project organization below
Forum wise, first step is to get a recruitment forum set up so we can organize the talent, get people set into teams (graphics, engine, UI, sound, PR, etc.), and start setting up the work environment. 0 A.D. uses Trac, however they have been considering a move to pure GitHub. 

To figure out what we have to do, we'll need a ticketing system as well as a group to make design decisions. GitHub has an issues system but something like Trac might work better given the hoped for volume of tickets project movement. 

To organize the code, we'd ideally run a single 'official' branch that exists for official dev team use and pulling code from the community. Depending on the styles of our developers, we might run the official branch as a pull-only branch so that it can be downloaded at any time and compiled so people know our progress.

For discussion, we'd ideally have IRC or some equivalent (google hangouts, anybody?) that can be used for general chat/Q&amp;A then have separate rooms for 'official' debate which are then immortalized in the forum for general reference. One of the major downfalls of many communities is the entrance difficulty because official communications are fragmented and often lost.

"I know something along these lines will have been suggested a hundred time before, but honestly, this IS what i would really want from this game. Its something along the lines of a mix of Minecraft, Some Industrial Mods, and Spacebuild. Also, i hope this is what other people had in mind for the game? 

Basically, what i've tried to build into this system is, the flexibility of a good platform (like Minecraft's Redstone + Blocks), empowering the player, and also putting some constraints, making the whole system a little more interesting, injecting in a little challenge, by trying to make sure theres no one route, better than any other. It also adds lots of room for a tech tree as well. [On the off chance you missed this](https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX), a good rant, which although very abstract for this situation, does provide some good insight into why its good to give the user the power to do these sort of things.

In the beginning, the game provides you with a starting ship, a nice small ship, with all the basics, power, computer etc, not too big, not too fast, but simple, a good base to work from. Where this diverges from the standard methodology is, the way you design ships, and this is where spacebuild (and tekkit) comes in, Rather than following the standard formula, with very superficial alterations, you manually build the systems form scratch. 

Before i get onto the topic, theres the very obvious problem of, what about those people who don't want that much depth (those same people who just want to build a nice house in minecraft)? Well, theres a multitude of ways of working around this, prebuilt modules, construction companies (player or npc), expanding the first ship, etc, take your pick.

Rather than some bastardisation of QTEs and minigames, you actually design and build the ship, how well it works, is a testament to how well you built it. An example of of why i think this could be REALLY fun: Imagine that you've taken damage to your rear engine, and it goes offline, so you pop out of the ship for a minute, wearing your spacesuit, propel yourself to the back of the ship, and take a look at the engine. What could be the problem? Glance in, and yo notice that a you've had a small explosion on the back of your ship, and its destroyed some covers, some pipes, and damaged the engine strut. So rather than pull out a magical welding torch, you open your backpack, and go start placing down some new support, place down some new wires and add a new cover, and then go a bit overboard on the armour, because if they'd hit a little harder, your engine would have dropped right off.

I should mention, personally, i think minigames suck, at least for this kind of task, so i tried to avoid them as much as physically possible.

Anyway, the more definite influences form Spacebuild would be its resource systems, and its storage systems. You'd pop down a resource container (or make a room for this, you'd need to try it to see which is a better system), and then you start placing down pipes to connect the storage container to a machine, or a dispenser, or even the engines, if you're desperate for some fuel.

The mod influences (especially Redpower,  though paraphrasing Eloraam, ""You're just implementing this straight of wikipedia"", its not copying). come in with the pipes, machines for controlling distribution, as well as frames style creations.

There were some other things i wanted to put down, but honestly they've, slipped my mind. So what do you want? And what do you think?

using PHP's unqid function sounds good for making ship IDs, you end up with something like this : 4fbf0710ca0e8


and for XXTEA, there are functions that exist for it in PHP and I hear its easy to port to DCPU. I was thinking of something like ""&lt;SHIPID&gt; -- &lt;KEY&gt;"" the key would be made by the onboard DCPU with something like a password set in the web-based interface and just encrypt the time, so that the key always changes and cannot be cloned unless you know the password. if you wanted to check if it was vaild, just relay the shipid and the key to the web backend, and get a reply back that its right",1337922031.0,CUBE - a game trailer that may be reminiscent of 0x10c

* The Integral part of the algorithm looks at how much error you have accumulated.

0,False,Whats the scoop on ships ?
"Let me preface the question with the following, so that everyone doesn't feel the need to remind me.... I realize the game is in development, not much is known and anything can change at any point. 

So all of my info about the game comes from [0x10c.com/](http://0x10c.com). I havent really scoured the internet for the latest nuggets of info, aside from trolling this subreddit. 

Thats when I read the follow nugget from Notch.

&gt;[Honestly, I'm MORE interested in the personal fighting than the ship fighting. I want the game to be about people on ships, not about the ships.](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/s5svp/interpersonal_out_of_ship_combat/c4brh9j)

The website mentions in the hopeful feature section ""Space battles against the AI or other players. "" Which I guess doesn't necessarily mean ship to ship combat, but thats how I took it. I don't think I was expecting any big space dog fights or star trek like battles, but maybe a little something like Xcom. Where you engage an enemy with your ship, neutralize it, then board it and let the fun begin. 

So I guess, maybe, I'm getting mixed signals. 

So if anyone has more insight or info into what role ships will have? Any word on ship to ship combat? How about upgrading and tweaking teh ships? Can I pimp my ride? 

Again, I realize that some/most/all of my question might be unanswerable. But I just want to know what the latest news/gossip is on ships in general. 

Thanks all!
